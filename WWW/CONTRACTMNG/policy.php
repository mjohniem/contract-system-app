			INTRODUCTION	</p>
		<P class="style9">This Policy and Procedures document is designed to ensure a common approach  across the Laikipia University Board
			to the procurement of  goods and services. At both EU and national levels, public procurement is 
		governed by a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework.</p>
		<P class="style9"> The aims of procurement rules and guidelines 
			are to achieve value for money and ensure that fair and transparent procedures are applied to all procurement 
			decisions.   
			 
			In this context,  the  policy and procedures manual  aims to ensure that the procurement function within the 
			Laikipia University  is discharged as effectively and efficiently as possible.  Primarily,  it  is intended to provide a quick 
			reference for all staff regarding the key issues that need to be considered in the context of procurement.  It also 
			provides a reference source for the purposes of obtaining more detailed advisory information as may be 
			necessary.  Please note that the document is not  intended to be a legal interpretation of existing procurement 
			legislation/guidance and staff should, as necessary, refer to the more detailed advisory documents available 
			and/or seek advice as may be appropriate.  
			Questions arising from this document or advice in relation to procurement should be addressed to 
			Procurement Officer or send us views,questions or comments through the contact us page.		</p>
		<P class="style9">Comprehensive guidance on procurement, including model tender documents and guidance issued nationally 
			for buyers and suppliers, is available online at this site. 

			This document will be reviewed and circulated annually and relevant updates will be emailed to all staff on an 
			ongoing basis.  If anyone has any suggestions as regards additional material/advice that could be included in the 
			document, please let us know.  

			 Procurement Principles and Project Appraisal  
			 
			Public Procurement can be defined as the acquisition, whether under formal contract or not, of works, 
			supplies and services by public bodies. It ranges from the purchase of routine supplies or services to formal 
		tendering and placing contracts for large infrastructural projects.  </p>
		<P class="style9">At both EU and national levels, public 
			procurement is governed by a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework.  The aims of procurement 
			rules and guidelines are to achieve value for money and ensure that fair and transparent procedures are 
			applied to all procurement decisions.   
			Overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with Laikipia University rules rests with the contracting or 
			purchasing sections.  The owners is on evaluation teams assessing tenders to be satisfied that the evaluation 
			and award process is conducted appropriately and that best value for money is achieved. All staff are 
			reminded that procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor 
			General (Amendment) Act 1993 and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred.  
			All managers should ensure that there is an appropriate focus on good practice in procurement and 
		purchasing and that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant guidelines.</p>
		<P align="center" class="style2"> GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>
		<P class="style9"> Important general principles to be observed by all sections involved in purchasing/procurement are set out 
		below:</p>
		<P class="style9">     Expertise and Probity 
			Staff involved in purchasing or placing contracts must be familiar with both the Laikipia University rules that 
			may apply (see Chapter 3). It is also incumbent on sections to take measures to separate functions within the 
			procurement cycle, by ensuring that, for example, ordering and receiving are distinct from payment for 
		goods and services.</p>
		<P class="style9">     Casual Purchases 
			Staff should examine purchasing profiles to minimize casual or “once off” purchases. An appropriate 
			contracting arrangement should be put in place for efficient and cost effective delivery of recurring supplies 
			and services.		</p>
		<P class="style9">    Sole Suppliers 
		  Where it is necessary to deal with a sole supplier, service provider or contractor, arrangements, which 
		  provide best value for money, should be negotiated.  This should only arise in very limited, exceptional 
		  circumstances.  Staff should exercise care in such cases and open-ended arrangements should be avoided.  
		  Please note that the reporting requirements relating to such procurement are set out in the section dealing 
		  with Circular 40/02</p>
		<P class="style9">     Conflict of Interest 
			Staff should be aware of potential conflicts of interest in the tendering process and should take appropriate 
			steps to avoid them.</p>
		<P class="style9">     Statutory Provisions 
		  Before awarding a contract, staff should ensure that tenderers have regard to statutory provisions such as 
		  minimum pay, legally binding industrial or sectoral agreements, relevant health and safety and accessibility 
		  issues, and other relevant issues such as green procurement. </p>
		<P class="style9">    Collusive Tendering 
		Staff should watch for anti-competitive practices such as collusive tendering.</p>
		<P class="style9">   Criminal Convictions 
		  Candidates or tenderers who have been convicted of involvement in organized crime, fraud, corruption or 
		  money laundering must be excluded from performing a public contract.</p>
		<P class="style9">   Procurement and Accessibility 
			Under Section 27(1) of the Disability Act 2005, a Public Body is required to ensure that goods and services 
			that are supplied to it are accessible to people with disabilities. Section 27 (2) of the Disability Act provides 
		that this requirement to ensure goods and services are accessible will not apply where:</p>
		<P class="style9">   it would not be practicable;</p>
		<P class="style9">   it would not be justified on the grounds of cost;</p>
		<P class="style9">   it would cause unreasonable delay in making goods and services available to other persons.  
			 
			In line with the provisions of the Disability Act, relevant accessibility requirements for people with disabilities 
			should, where appropriate, be included in all stages of the tender process - specification, tendering, 
			evaluation, award and review.		</p>
		<P class="style9">  Green Procurement  
			Staff are reminded of the need to consider environmental specifications when issuing tenders.  
			   
			Laikipia University strives to provide the highest quality of service to our clients and stakeholders.  In this regard, and in 
			response to energy efficiency targets for the public sector, It is committed to the continual 
			assessment and improvement of our environmental performance. 
			 
			Laikipia University is committed to the core principles of environmental sustainability and protection.  Throughout our 
			operations we strive to minimise our impact on the environment, via sustainable procurement and the 
			efficient management of resources such as energy and waste. 
			 
			Environmental responsibility is the cornerstone of the Agency’s environmental policy.  In order to honour this 
		commitment, we shall continue to:</p>
		<P class="style9">   Meet or exceed all our obligations with regard to environmental legislation;</p>
		<P class="style9">   Adhere to our environmental procurement policy to promote the selection of environmentally superior 
	    products and services;</p>
		<P class="style9">   Commission an independent third party assessment of all our activities on an annual basis;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Continuously strive to improve reporting methodologies and documentation to ensure transparency 
			  and credibility;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Develop a set of clearly identifiable annual targets to improve energy efficiency, minimize waste 
			  generated and reduce our carbon footprint;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Communicate our progress, in respect of these targets, to all stakeholders;</p>
		<P class="style9">   Promote environmental awareness and commitment amongst staff; </p>
		<P class="style9">  Encourage best practice across the wider film industry by making available our recommended best 
			  practice guidelines; 
			  Advance towards an overall improvement in energy efficiency by 33% by 2020, in accordance with 
    government targets.</p>
		<P class="style9">   Verifiable Audit Trail 
			Written records supporting all procurement decisions, including business case submissions, should always be 
			retained for audit purposes.  This includes all information on tender process undertaken, evaluation and 
			award of contract.	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style3"> PROJECT APPRAISAL AND INITIATION – SOME KEY ISSUES</p>
		<P class="style9"> All prospective procurement projects should be planned well in advance. The staff member proposing the 
			procurement should discuss all aspects of the project with their respective line managers to determine if the 
			identified need is a priority. It goes without saying that all procurement exercises should be fully justified and 
			the intended outcome or deliverable from the project should be clearly outlined as part of the appraisal.  
			Equally, in order to determine what procurement procedure needs to be followed (see Chapter 3), a full and 
			realistic assessment of the costs associated with the project must be undertaken as part of the project 
			appraisal.  
			 
			Budget 
			Once the proposed procurement is approved in principle by the relevant line manager, sanction must be 
			sought from the Deputy CEO prior to the commencement of the procurement process. The Deputy CEO will 
			consult with the Financial Controller to ensure sufficient monies are available within the budget before 
			approval is given. A determination also needs to be made as to whether the expenditure falls under the 
			category of current or capital.   
			 
			ICT Procurement 
			Please note also, that all ICT related procurements for the Laikipia University functions are dealt with by the IT 
			Committee. The use of central and Departmental ICT Framework agreements is favoured wherever possible.  
			 
			Process Audit 
			A Process Audit procedure is in place to ensure proper procurement and tendering occurs across the Agency 
			(see Appendix 7 for copy of Process Audit Form).  All procurement exercises where the potential value of the 
			contract is in excess of €25,000 (excluding VAT) is subject to the process audit procedure.  In addition, the 
			procurement of every consultancy, regardless of the value of the contract, must go through the process audit 
			procedure.  It is essential that the process audit is performed after tender evaluation but before the award of 
			a contract so that compliance with procedures can be verified in advance of contract signature.  A copy of 
			the completed form must be forwarded to the Deputy CEO and the Procurement Officer for approval in 
			advance of the contract being signed.  The Procurement Officer maintains a central register of contracts 
			entered into by the Agency and also a separate register of consultancies, based on information contained in 
			Process Audit Forms. 
			 
			Please allow a reasonable period for us to fully consider the information on the Process Audit Form and to 
			clarify any issue, if necessary. 
			 
			It is essential that copies of signed and dated Process Audit Forms and all relevant documentation, including 
			approvals from the Procurement Officer, are filed safely for retrieval in case of future queries.  
			Responsibility in this regard rests with the Procurement Officer. 
			 
			 
			There are essentially two procurement routes to be followed, one for contracts below the LU threshold values 
			and the other for contracts above the LU threshold. 
			
			Direct Invitation (without Advertising) 
			Alternatively a process of direct invitation to tender may be used. This may involve:	</p>
		<P class="style9">  invitation to firms deemed appropriately qualified for a particular project (this may be appropriate for 
	specialised requirements in markets where there is a limited number of suppliers or service providers);</p>
		<P class="style9">   invitation to tender to firms on a list established on an open and objective basis (normally used when 
			there is a frequent or recurring requirement or to maintain a well organised ongoing procurement 
			system). 
			 
			Where direct invitations are issued, firms from which tenders are sought should be a good representative 
			sample of all potential bidders in the market concerned. The number must be sufficient to ensure adequate 
			competition, and should not be restricted for reasons of administrative convenience. At least five firms should 
			normally be invited to submit tenders. 
			 
			If a Unit maintains a list of firms from which they invite tenders, this should be advertised at appropriate 
			intervals (normally on an annual basis) for the admission of interested parties. Care should be taken to ensure 
			that such lists are used in an open and non - discriminatory manner and those recently established firms, or 
			firms with no previous experience of public contracts, are not excluded from invitations to tender. 
			 
			The methods and criteria for selecting firms and for awarding contracts should be documented and should be 
			objective, transparent and proportionate. It should be clearly understood that whether responses are to an 
			advertisement or to a direct invitation, all parties in the process must be treated on the same fair and objective 
			basis. Decisions on selections for smaller projects or purchases should be recorded with a minimum of formality.    </p>
		<P align="center" class="style3">AWARDING A CONTRACT WITHOUT A COMPETITIVE PROCESS	</p>
		<P class="style9">Awarding a contract below the LU value threshold without the use of a competitive process should be 
			considered only in the following instances:	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Where only a proprietary product will meet requirements, such as parts or components for equipment.	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Where an agent, licensee or franchise holder has sole rights to supply a service or product.	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Where there is only one suitable qualified specialist in the relevant field.	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Where a particular service provider possesses a special advantage due, for example, to earlier research 
			exclusively carried out in a particular area, or has exclusive data or information required performing a 
			particular task. In such circumstances, it must be demonstrably clear that another service provider 
			could not perform a contract more economically.	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Where due to the urgency a competitive process cannot be undertaken in the time available. What 
			constitutes urgency cannot be specified definitively. Factors giving rise to urgency must be serious, 
			unforeseeable and, except in the most exceptional circumstances (for instance a matter of urgent 
			public safety or the like) not due to the action or inaction on the part of the Agency. Occasions when it 
			is necessary to award a contract without a competitive process due to urgency should be very rare 
			because an appropriate competitive process can be completed relative quickly below thresholds, by 
			direct invitation to tender to a number of suitably qualified suppliers or service providers (see Direct 
			Invitation). 
			 
			When awarding a contract, care should be taken to avoid entering into open-ended arrangements, for 
			administrative convenience, that reduces or hinders competition and contracts should not roll over indefinitely.  
			Having regard to the principles of fairness and proportionality, the duration of contracts should be reasonable in 
			terms of the value of the contract, the nature of the work, the market situation etc. and should not be so long 
			that new operators in the market are not afforded an opportunity to compete.  In this regard, market testing 
			should be undertaken at appropriate intervals to ensure that market openness and competition is maintained. It 
			may be even appropriate to advertise in the 

			Contract periods should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they are still within “date”.  It is critical 
			that a process is undertaken to retender for the relevant goods/services in good time prior to the expiration of 
			the original contract, in accordance with proper procurement procedures and subject to prior approval by the 
			Procurement Officer.  Particular attention is needed in relation to maintenance/service agreements, annual 
			license fees etc. where no competitive process took place in the year but which have stemmed from an initial 
			competitive process.  Contract periods that have lapsed must therefore be included on the 40/02 return to the 
			C&AG once they exceed the threshold. The C&AG has advised that contract extensions not explicitly provided for 
			in a contract must be treated as a “single” tender for this purpose.	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style3">LAIKIPIA UNIVERSITY  TENDERING PROCEDURES	</p>
		<P class="style9">The current LU public sector Directives permit four tendering procedures (see paragraph 3.5 regarding proposed 
			new Directives).  The two more commonly used of these are detailed below, whilst reference is made to the 
			other two processes. Further information in relation to the latter can be found in the document Public 
	Procurement Guidelines – Competitive Process 2010 (available on the extranet).</p>
		<P class="style9">(i)  Open 
			Under this procedure all interested parties may submit tenders. Information on tenderers’ capacity 
			and expertise may be sought and only the tenders of those deemed to meet minimum levels of 
			technical and financial capacity and expertise are evaluated. If there are minimum requirements it is 
			important that they be made clear in the notice or the request for tenders (RFT) to avoid unqualified 
			bidders incurring the expense of preparing and submitting tenders. The open procedure should be 
			utilized for goods and services contracts below the value of €134,000.	</p>
		<P class="style9">(ii)  Restricted  
			This is a two-stage process where only those parties who meet minimum requirements in regard to 
			professional or technical capability, experience and expertise and financial capacity to carry out a 
	project are invited to tender.</p>
		<P class="style9">   As a first step, the requirements of the contracting authority are set out through a contract notice 
			in the  expressions of interest are invited from potential tenderers. The contract notice 
			may indicate the relevant information to be submitted or the information may be sought via a 
			detailed questionnaire to interested parties.	</p>
		<P class="style9">	  The second step involves issuing the complete specifications and tender documents (RFT) with an 
			invitation to submit tenders only to those who possess the requisite level of professional, technical 
			and financial expertise and capacity. It is important to note that, as a basis for pre - qualifying 
			candidates, only the criteria relating to personal situation, financial capacity, technical capacity, 
			relevant experience, expertise and competency of candidates set out in the revised Directive 
			(Articles 45 to 48 of 2004/18/EC) are permissible.  
			 
			Contracting authorities may opt to shortlist qualified candidates if this intention is indicated in the 
			contract notice and the number or range of candidates indicated. Short listing of candidates who 
			meet the minimum qualification criteria must be carried out by non-discriminatory and transparent 
			rules and criteria made known to candidates. The Directives require that a number sufficient to 
			ensure adequate competition is invited to submit bids and indicate a minimum of five (provided there 
			is at least this number who meet the qualification criteria) and up to a total of 20.	</p>
		<P class="style9">(iii)&(iv)    Competitive Dialogue and Negotiated procedures.  
			The competitive dialogue designed to provide more flexibility in the tendering process for more 
			complex contracts, for example public private partnerships (PPPs). In terms of the Negotiated 
			procedure, this is an exceptional procedure, which may be used only in the limited circumstances set 
			out 

			Time-limits for Replies 
			At LU level, minimum time-limits are set down for the different stages of the particular contract award 
			procedure chosen. In all cases, the times specified in days relate to calendar days. When fixing the timescale for 
			submitting expressions of interest / requests to participate or tenders, contracting authorities should take 
			account of the complexity of the contract and allow sufficient time for submitting the necessary information and 
			preparing tenders.  
			 
			Electronic / Online Transmission 
			Minimum times for responses may be reduced where contract notices are transmitted electronically to the Procurement office 
			and all tender documentation is made available electronically in accordance with the provisions of the revised 
			Directives. The reduction can be up to a cumulative 12 days.  Conditions for availing of these potential time 
			reductions are set out. 
																	   
			The use of the urgent procedures, or accelerated procedures, as referred to in the Directives, must be justified and have been caused by unforeseeable 
			events outside the control of the contracting authority. The EU Commission and ECJ interpret ‘urgency’ very strictly. Delay or inaction on the part of the 
			contracting authority is not sufficient reason for applying exceptional procedures. 
			 
			 Preparing Tender Documentation 
			 
			In terms of the preparation of tender documentation, sections should note the development of a suite of 
			documents by the Office of Laikipia Procurement designed for use in the procurement of routine, 
			non-bespoke and low to medium risk supplies and services, including model Request for Tenders (RFTs) and 
			model contract documents.     
			 
			In general, care should be taken to ensure that tender documentation is complete, relevant and proportionate 
			to the need. Small and medium sized enterprises frequently report that they find public sector tendering 
			documentation complex and difficult to follow. In many cases, this arises from lengthy and detailed standard 
	type provisions for larger contracts being “cut and pasted” into documentation for smaller requirements.</p>
		<P align="center" class="style4"> GENERAL RFT REQUIREMENTS AND TIPS FOR RFT DEVELOPMENT	</p>
		<P class="style9">RFTs generally contain the following sections (not prescriptive/ exhaustive):	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Background and summary of requirements;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Financial and invoicing arrangements;</p>
		<P class="style9">   Contact details for further information and query handling – as well as rules relating to same;</p>
		<P class="style9">   General instructions to tenderers in relation to submission of tenders and required format of tender 
			responses;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Specifications (comprehensive and unambiguous descriptions) of the services, goods or works required;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Conditions applicable to the contract including, for example, time for delivery, payments schedule, liability 
	for defects, insurance provisions, settlement of disputes etc.;</p>
		<P class="style9">   Examination and evaluation of tenders - the RFT must state all of the criteria being applied in the award 
			process, giving the relative weighting for each criterion. If it is not technically possible to indicate criteria 
			weightings in advance, they must be listed in descending order of importance;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Obligations and restrictions imposed by the contracting authority, including details of the statutory 
			provisions that the contracting authority is expected to adhere to regarding employment rights, minimum 
			wage agreements, FOI provisions etc.;	</p>
		<P class="style9">  Details of the Agency’s adherence to policies in relation to accessibility, green procurement etc.  
			 
			In terms of tips for drawing up RFTs, the following should be considered:	</p>
		<P class="style9">1.  Start with the Request for Tender (RFT) sample on the etenders website.</p>
		<P class="style9"> 2.  Be very clear in what you are looking for to ensure that you get tenders that fit your needs. Make sure you 
	set out under what criteria the tenders will be evaluated.</p>
		<P class="style9"> 3.  Avoid using ambiguous phrases that may be misinterpreted by the suppliers, such as “quality of tender” in 
			the award criteria, and address in the RFT any possible questions that may arise. If appropriate, ask 
			someone not involved in the project to read the documentation and ensure it is clear. You will have a better 
			chance of getting what you want if you are very specific in stating exactly what you will measure (e.g. the 
			extent to which the tender meets the technical requirements specified in a certain paragraph, etc.).	</p>
		<P class="style9">4.  It can be helpful to include a return check list (with tick-boxes) for suppliers so that they can be sure that 
			they have satisfied all requirements mentioned in the documents. This can also be helpful to the buyer in 
			summarizing what they need from suppliers.</p>
		<P class="style9"> 5.  Include any timescales associated with the project early in the notice. This includes the latest date for 
		  submission of queries relating to the project, the closing date and time for submission of tenders, etc. Many 
		  buyers only state the closing date; however, suppliers often like to know when the evaluation might be 
		  completed or when the contract is likely to take effect.</p>
		<P class="style9"> 6.  In some projects, it may be useful to indicate a budget for the project in the RFT. This can give potential 
		  suppliers an idea of the range of the project, and they can tailor their submissions to meet this budget. </p>
		<P class="style9">7.  If possible, upload any tender documentation that may help clarify the tender on to the etenders website. 
			This will reduce the need for contracting authorities to send any relevant documentation manually at a later 
	date.</p>
		<P class="style9"> 8.  When uploading any tender documentation, ensure that the size of the documents is kept small. This will 
			allow the documents to be accessed by those on slower internet connections, such as dial-up. It is also 
	useful to consider using PDF documents, which are harder to alter than standard text documents.</p>
		<P class="style9"> 9.  Contracting authorities may also include a statement in the RFT prohibiting the RFT being passed to a third 
			party without the authorities’ permission. This is particularly relevant in the case of tenders advertised and 
			documentation made available on the etenders website. Candidates who register with the site and 
			download tender documents will automatically receive any clarifications or additions to the original 
			documentation. If the documentation is passed on by a third party to a supplier not registered with the site, 
			that supplier may miss out on important additional information.	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style3">CRITERIA FOR AWARDING CONTRACTS</p>
		<P class="style9"> Establishing Criteria 
			When establishing criteria for awarding contracts, contracting authorities may choose to award contracts on the 
			basis of:			</p>
		<P class="style9">  the lowest priced tender      
		  or </p>
		<P class="style9">  the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) 
			 
			In general, for contracts being awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT), 
			transparency and objectivity are best demonstrated by the use of a scoring system or marking sheet based on 
			the relevant weighted criteria, including price.  The RFT must state all of the criteria being applied in the award 
			process.  Contracts above the EU thresholds must, in addition to stating all of the criteria being applied in the 
			award process, give the relative weightings of each criterion.  The scoring system or marking scheme should be 
			agreed and documented by the relevant Division, and approved by the relevant Principal Officer, in advance of 
			the invitation of tenders.  New or amended criteria must not be introduced in the course of the contract award 
			procedure. If significant additional information or material is supplied to a candidate, on request or otherwise, it 
			must be supplied to all candidates.  
			 
			Timescales 
			For contracts below the thresholds there are no prescribed time limits for the submission of tenders, but 
			sufficient time must be allowed for preparation and submission. The complexity of a project and other relevant 
			factors (e.g. holiday periods) relating to the preparation of tenders should be taken into account. In this context, 
			a minimum 20 day response period is suggested. In the case of contracts in excess of EU Directive thresholds, 
			sections must ensure that the timescale complies with the minimum periods specified in the Directives (see 
			section on Procurement above Threshold Directives. 

			Engagement with prospective tenderers during tender cycle 
			Responses to requests for information from prospective tenderers must be issued without delay and in any 
			event within a maximum of six days of the request. Additional information, requested in good time, must be 
			issued at least six days before the latest date for receipt of tenders.  In order to avoid giving unfair advantage, 
			additional information supplied to one party in response to a request should be supplied to all interested parties 
			if it could be significant in the context of preparing a tender. This functionality is available on etenders as all of 
			the email addresses of the prospective tenderers have already been filed.   
			 
			Evaluating Tenders Received 
			   
			A rigorous and clearly documented process must be followed when evaluating all tenders.  
			A schedule of all tenders received, specifying date and time received, should be recorded in the period of receipt 
			and tenders received after the closing time for receipt of tenders should not be opened.  All tenders validly 
			received should be opened at the same time in the presence of at least two staff members, as soon as possible 
			after the time set for receipt of tenders.  One of the officers should be of at least HEO level and one should be 
			unconnected to the competition in question.  A report of the opening of tenders should be prepared signed and 
			dated by the two officers as evidence of receiving the tender by the due date and should include details of 
			anyone else who was in attendance, date of opening of tenders and other relevant details.  
			 
			Composition of Evaluation Team:  
			 
			  For contracts up to  €10,000 (inclusive of VAT), the team will consist of no less than three members.  A 
			senior staff member who is not involved in the procurement process, must be included on the 
			evaluation team. In most instances this senior staff member will be either the DCEO or the CEO. 
			 
			  For contracts over €20,000 (inclusive of VAT), the team will consist of no less than three members.  The 
			CEO must approve the composition of the evaluation team before tenders are invited.  Any subsequent 
			changes must be similarly approved.  The CEO should decide whether a member of the Board or an 
			external specialist should be included on the evaluation team in addition to a senior staff member not 
			involved in the procurement process. In most instances this senior staff member will be either the 
			DCEO or the CEO 
			 
			The onus is on evaluation teams assessing tenders to be satisfied that the evaluation and award process is 
			conducted appropriately, that the agreed marking scheme is used, that best value for money is achieved and, 
			crucially, that all processes are adequately documented and records maintained.

		<P class="style9">The evaluation and award process must be demonstrably objective and transparent and based solely on the 
	published criteria. Price should be evaluated exclusive of VAT.</p>
		<P class="style9"> (i)  Where price is the sole criterion, the contract will be awarded to the lowest priced bid complying with 
			the specified requirements.	</p>
		<P class="style9">(ii)  Where ‘most economically advantageous tender’ (MEAT) is the basis, the contract must be awarded to 
			the tender which best meets the relevant criteria. In addition to price this will include other criteria 
			relevant to the subject of the contract. For example, this may include running costs, servicing costs, 
			level of after sales service, technical assistance, technical merit, environmental characteristics. The 
			criteria, with the relevant weighting, will have been pre– established and made known to the tenderers, 
			either in the contract notice or the tender documentation (RFT).  
			 
			Tenders must be evaluated objectively and transparently against the published weighted criteria.  It is useful to 
			first draw up a list of basic requirements, which each tenderer must meet prior to being fully evaluated.  Such a 
			list might include – financial viability statement; confirmation of relevant insurance requirements; statements 
			indicating compliance with relevant statutory requirements e.g. – industrial wage agreements etc.; ability to 
			provide service nationwide.   
			 
			Objectivity and transparency is best achieved by the use of a scoring system or marking sheet based on the 
			weighted criteria, indicating a comparative assessment of tenders under each criterion.  The scoring system 
			must include price and not ‘value for money’ or ‘cost effectiveness’ as a specific criterion.  Value for money / 
			cost effectiveness / economic advantage is largely the outcome of the completed evaluation.  
			(See Appendix 3 for sample of an evaluation score sheet).   
			
			A suitable marking scheme for evaluating tenders may be something along the lines of the following: 
			 
			•  Quality of Service Proposal (40 marks) 
			•  Cost (30 marks) 
			•  Proven ability of supplier to deliver service, including information obtained from referees and sites, if 
			applicable (20 marks) 
			•  Effective contract management & monitoring procedures (10 marks) 
			 
			In the case of an example such as the above, where it is intended that the ‘most economically advantageous 
			tender’ (MEAT) will be the basis for awarding the contract,  an initial evaluation and marks should be awarded to 
			each tender for cost.   The marks for cost should be calculated on the basis that the lowest tender is awarded 
			the full 30 marks and the points are reduced in proportion for the following tenders (i.e. Formula = Lowest Cost x 
			Total Marks for Cost/Your Cost).  Each member of the evaluation team should use the same formula for cost, 
			thus ensuring that each tender is awarded the same marks for this part of the evaluation exercise.  
			Independently, each member of the evaluation team should then examine each tender and award marks for the 
			other criteria.  An evaluation team average mark per tender submitted might then be awarded to determine the 
			outcome.  Prior to any notifications on results issuing, the references of each company should be checked.    
			 
			Presentations 
			In open or restricted procedures, the most competitive or advantageous tenderers are frequently asked to make 
			a presentation on their proposals. These presentations are used as an aid to understanding and for purposes of 
			elaboration and clarification. Any dialogue with tenderers that could be construed as "post tender negotiation" 
			on price, or result in significant changes to criteria or tender specifications, is to be avoided. Such negotiations, 
			outside the exceptional and clearly defined circumstances where EU rules permit, could contravene the EU 
			procurement Directives.  
			 
			Abnormally Low Tenders 
			A tender which might be regarded as abnormally low may not be rejected without investigation and 
			consideration of the relevant elements that gave rise to a particularly low bid. Such elements might include an 
			innovative technical solution or exceptionally favorable conditions available to the tenderer. The tenderer should 
	be given the opportunity to explain the basis of the tender.</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9"> <span class="style8">NOTIFYING TENDERERS</span></p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">All tenderers must be informed of the result of a tendering process without delay.  
			 
			Apart from observing the legal obligations where the provisions of the procurement Directives apply, it is good 
			practice to adopt a voluntary constructive policy on de-briefing unsuccessful candidates.  Unsuccessful tenderers 
			should be given an objective assessment of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of their tenders having 
			due regard to the need to avoid compromising the competitive situation of tenderers and for commercial 
			sensitivity.  
			 
			In the case of contracts under €25,000 unsuccessful candidates should at a minimum be informed of the 
			outcome of their tender by reference to their performance under the relevant evaluation criteria used in the 
			competition. It is also useful to assess this performance vis-à-vis the performance of the highest and lowest 
			marks awarded.  In addition to a letter setting out these details, an offer of feedback by telephone should 
			normally be sufficient subject to being satisfied as to the identity of the tenderer. 
			 
			In the case of larger contracts above €25,000 unsuccessful tenderers should be afforded an opportunity of a 
			debriefing meeting. While many requests may be satisfied by telephone feedback, where a more formal or 
			personal debriefing is required it would be normal practice to have two officials in attendance and a note of the 
			proceedings be kept for the records.  Tenderers should be made aware that the decision was not just the 
			opinion of one individual but was made by an evaluation team. The discussions should address the tenderers 
			offer against the evaluation criteria focusing on the relevant strengths and weaknesses of the tender. It is 
			imperative that information such as the identity or the prices of other tenderers or information that could 
			compromise the competitive situation not be disclosed.    
			
			The debriefing should not be a forum to debate the process of how tenders were evaluated or discuss the merits 
			of the award decision. 
			 
			The EU Remedies Directives require that unsuccessful tenderers for contracts covered by the EU Directives be 
			notified promptly of the outcome of a tendering competition and that a contract be not formally awarded 
			before an interval - 14 days electronically and 16 days by letter - has elapsed during which an unsuccessful 
			tenderer can seek a review of the decision.  The standstill period starts the day after the day on which the 
			notification is sent.  The purpose of the standstill period is to allow for effective pre-contract remedy to 
			disappointed tenderers and the contracting authority may not conclude a contract with an identified preferred 
			bidder during this time.    </p>
		<P align="center" class="style5">TAX CLEARANCE	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">Before a contract is awarded, the successful tenderer must hold a valid Tax Clearance Certificate from the 
			Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue provides an online verification facility to allow third party access to the 
			applicant’s tax cleared status.  This secure facility can only be accessed with the permission of the applicant, who 
			will quote the customer number and tax clearance number, which appear on the certificate.  Access to the 
			online verification can be located at www.revenue.ie “What can I do online”, “Tax Clearance”.  There is no need 
			for the applicant to produce the original certificate to confirm his/her tax-cleared status.    </p>
		<P align="center" class="style5">CONTRACT AWARD NOTICE	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">It is a requirement that contracting authorities publish certain information on contracts awarded (or framework 
			agreements concluded) within 48 days of the award in the OJEU. Particulars, including the type of contract, the 
			procedure and award criteria used, the number of tenders received, the name of the successful tenderer, the 
			value of the contract or the range of tender prices, justification for the negotiated procedure, if used, are 
			published. The necessary information can be submitted online to the OJEU or electronically on the standard 
			‘Contract Award Notice’.   
			 
			There is a new requirement for public bodies to publish contract award notices for contracts valued at over 
			€25,000 on etenders with effect from 1st August 2014. This is a separate step to advertising in the OJEU and will 
			facilitate measurement of SME participation in public procurement.  
			 Post Tender Process 
			 
			A Process Audit procedure is in place to ensure that proper procurement and tendering occurs across the 
			Department (see Appendix 7 for copy of Process Audit Form).  All procurement exercises where the potential 
			value of the contract will exceed €25,000 (excluding VAT) are subject to the process audit procedure.  Where the 
			estimated value of the contract is close to the €25,000 threshold, it may be prudent to submit a Process Audit 
			Form to cover the possibility that the threshold may be exceeded. In addition, the procurement of every 
			consultancy, regardless of the value of the contract, must go through the process audit procedure.  It is essential 
			that the process audit is performed after tender evaluation but before the award of a contract so that 
			compliance with procedures can be verified in advance of contract signature.  A copy of the completed form 
			must be forwarded to the Procurement Officer for approval in advance of the contract being signed.   The 
			Procurement Officer maintains a central register of contracts entered into by the Agency and also a separate 
			register of consultancies, based on information contained in Process Audit Forms. 
			 
			Please allow a reasonable period for the Procurement Officer to fully consider the information on the Process 
			Audit Form and to clarify any issue, if necessary.  If the contract date is imminent, please alert the Procurement 
			Officer in advance and consider sending a provisional Process Audit Form pending the submission of the final 
			signed and dated Form.  This will help to ensure a timely response, especially during periods of annual leave etc.  
			 
			It is essential that copies of signed and dated Process Audit Forms and all relevant documentation, including 
			approvals from the Procurement Officer, are filed safely in the section for retrieval in case of future queries, 
			particularly by the C&AG.  Responsibility in this regard rests with the Procurement Officer	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style3">CONTRACT	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">The Office of Laikipia University Procurement has produced a suite of documents to be used for the 
			procurement of low to medium risk goods and services.  Staff should examine model /template contract 
			documents that are available to be downloaded from etenders.ie for the provision of goods and services. Care 
			should be exercised that in the case where the service/goods are bespoke in nature or where staff may have 
			concerns with regard to any aspect relating to the subject matter of the procurement, then legal or other 
			advices should be sought.	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style3">MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">It is crucial that every stage and aspect of the procurement process is documented.  The importance of 
			maintaining an accurate and complete record of the procurement process and decisions made cannot be 
			overstated.  The records should always consist of a procurement file and in some cases a project management 
			file. The procurement file should include the business case/specifications/research conducted/procurement 
			process from advertisement through to award of contract (see detail below).  The contract management file 
			should contain the day-to-day management of the contract including performance reviews and payments made 
			against the contract. 
			 
			The rationale underpinning key decisions and submissions/approvals should be noted on file as sections may be 
			asked to justify a decision sometime after the event.  One set of agreed scoring sheets should be signed by all 
			members of the evaluation team and retained.  
			 
			The checklist set out at Appendix 5 is a useful means of ensuring that all stages in the procurement process are 
			observed and that all relevant aspects are considered. This can be used as a template for a procurement report 
			detailing the procedures followed and will assist in following the audit trail.  All records must be kept for a period 
			of at least seven (7) years.  
			
			In a standard open procurement process the following records should be retained on the procurement file:  
			 
			•  The approved Business Case and reference to/copy of approval e.g. written approval from the CEO or 
			DCEO,Board minutes of (date); 
			•  The published Request for Tenders, including copies of the notices which appeared in the OJEU where 
			relevant; 
			•  Correspondence with potential bidders and/or other relevant correspondence;  
			•  Clarifications provided and evidence of circulation of additional information to all interested bidders via the 
			etenders facility;  
			•  Copies of Tenders received; 
			•  Evidence of the receipt of tenders including time and date (a schedule of all tenders received should be 
			prepared); 
			•  Report of the opening of the tenders (including the schedule of tenders) should be prepared detailing who 
			was in attendance, date of opening of tenders etc.; 
			•  Scoring of tenders and evaluation of tenders including clear scoring methodology signed by evaluation 
			team; 
			•  Letters to unqualified bidders, shortlisted bidders, unsuccessful bidders, successful bidder (or as 
			appropriate to competition);  
			•  Minutes of meetings with potential suppliers; 
			•  Contract and contract award notice; 
			•  Any variations to the contract.	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style6">CONTRACT MANAGEMENT	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">The management of the contract should be seen as an integral part of the procurement process and suppliers 
			should be proactively managed once the contract is in place. It is incumbent on the budget holder/project 
			manager to ensure that the terms of the contract are delivered. Consideration should be given to including 
			performance review milestones into the contract (e.g. the contract is for an initial period of 12 months and will 
			be renewed for another 6/12 months subject to satisfactory performance in the review period). Ongoing 
			monitoring of performance should be undertaken and noted on the contract file. Signing off on invoices and 		approving purchase orders for payments is an indication that you are satisfied with the service/goods provided 
			and should not be done until you are satisfied that the terms of the contract have been met. If companies fail to 
			meet these requirements they should be contacted immediately and a management process of improvement 
			put in place. A full written record of all correspondence with/from the supplier should be maintained. Once a 
			contract is completed it is good practice to review the entire procurement process noting the supplier’s 
			performance and effectiveness of the procurement process itself.	</p>
		<P align="center" class="style3">ENGAGEMENT OF CONSULTANTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL SUPPORT</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9"> Consultancy is where a person, organization or group thereof is engaged to provide intellectual or knowledge-
			based services (e.g. expert analysis and advice) through delivering reports, studies, assessments, 
			recommendations, proposals, etc. that contribute to decision - or policy-making in a contracting authority. The 
			engagement should be for a limited time period to carry out a specific finite task or set of tasks that involve 
			expert skills or capabilities that would not normally be expected to reside within this Agency.  
			 
			In line with Department of Finance directives, all consultancies
			
			 must be approved at CEO level before they are 
			commenced. No new consultancies should be entered into or new commitments made without first consulting 
			the Procurement Officer. This applies not just to consultancies funded from the Administration Budget but also 
			to those funded directly from the Capital Budget also. Only on approval by the CEO can consultancies 
			commence. See Appendix 6 for further clarification.  In addition, the procurement of every consultancy, 
			regardless of the value of the contract, must go through the process audit procedure.  It is essential that the 
			process audit is performed after tender evaluation but before the award of a contract so that compliance with 
			procedures can be verified in advance of contract signature. 
			 
			A contractor is a person, organisation or group thereof engaged, for a limited time period, to provide specified 
			goods, works or services (including ICT services) that implement established policy objectives; to assist the 
			Agency in carrying out its operations and functions; or to perform operations or functions that involve skills or 
			capabilities that would normally be expected to reside within the Agency but which are not currently available. 
			Contractors come under the direction of the Agency for operational purposes and take day-to-day instructions 
			from local management even though they are not employees of the contracting authority. Particular care should 
			be taken at all times to ensure that such contractors are not at any stage explicitly or implicitly treated as 
			employees of this Agency. 
			 
			External Service Providers are organisations that provide the services or the human/physical resources to meet 
			the ICT and other service requirements of the Agency. These requirements could include software development; 
			network installation and management; infrastructure management; data centre hosting;  managed services; 
																		
			2
			 From the Department’s perspective, the definition of a consultancy  is set out in an email circulated by Trevor Donnelly on 17/1/13; copy attached 
			Appendix 6 
				
			26 
			 
			shared services, etc. External service provision involves the transfer of actions for delivering business functions 
			or services to an external service provider but does not include the use of contractors (i.e. external support 
			under the day-to-day direction of the contracting authority) or the cost of purchasing packaged software. 
			 
			Additionally, external support may be required where: 
			•  a need for an external assessment is deemed essential; 
			•  a study or review is required by an external body (e.g. the European Commission); 
			•  a study/project must be completed within a short time scale and, although the knowledge or expertise 
			may be available within the Agency, performing the task in-house would involve a prohibitive opportunity 
			cost (i.e. total cost of diverted staff, including relevant overheads etc.) or would be impractical (e.g. staff 
			engaged on other essential duties would have to be diverted), or it might not be possible to redeploy staff 
			cost-effectively in the timeframe required. 
			 
			Formal Tendering Process (Consultancies) 
			 
			Staff should note that Units must, in advance: 
			 
			•  notify the CEO (who in turn may notify the Board) where non-routine consultancies arise or, in the case of 
			routine consultancies, those in excess of €50,000; 
			•  obtain the explicit approval of the Board for consultancies in excess of €100,000.  In such cases, approval 
			also needs to be secured for the proposed tendering process and composition of the tender evaluation 
			team; 
			 
			In addition, the procurement of every consultancy, regardless of the value of the contract, must go through the 
			process audit procedure (please consult Chapter 5).  
			 
			Finally, the Agency must maintain registers of their consultancies.  Information contained within it is collated as 
			part of the Process Audit return.   
			 
			The specification for consultancy services should include: 
			•  Brief background on the Agency including scale and number of staff etc; 
			•  Details and background of the proposed assignment; 
			•  Required deliverables from consultant; 
			•  Timeline including proposed starting date; 
			•  Outline resources to be provided by the Agency/Section if relevant; 
			•  Reporting  & contact details; 
			•  Selection details including contract award criteria; 
			•  If required, notification that presentation to selection panel must be made; 
		  •  Request for reference details and CV’s of proposed project team.</p>

		  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WITHHOLDING TAX (PSWT) </p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">Professional Services Withholding Tax (PSWT) must be deducted at the standard rate of tax from payments for 
		  professional services.  These services include: 
		  
		    Services of an architectural, engineering, quantity surveying or surveying nature and related services 
		    Services of a solicitor or barrister or other legal services 
		    Geological services 
		    Marketing, advertising or other consultancies 
		  
		  The rate at which PSWT is deducted is the standard rate of tax in force at the date on which the relevant 
		  payment is made.  The standard rate of income tax at the date of issue of this guide (tax year 2014) is 20%.  
		  PSWT is deducted from the total amount of the payment for the professional service involved, including, in 
		  general, any amount in respect of expenses, outlay or third party costs, but excluding any VAT charged by the 
		  person providing the service.  PSWT must be deducted even where a valid Tax Clearance Certificate has been 
		  produced.    
		  27 
		  
		  
		  More information on PSWT is available in a booklet “A Revenue Guide to Professional Services Withholding Tax 
		  (PSWT) for Accountable Persons and Specified Persons” which is published on www.revenue.ie. 
		  
		  7.5  ELECTRONIC RELEVANT CONTRACTS TAX (ERCT) 
		  
		  An Electronic Relevant Contracts Tax (eRCT) regime came into effect from 1st January 2012.  eRCT is applicable 
		  for building and construction work (including alteration and repair), and Forestry. In the context the BSÉ/IFB is 
		  the Principal in terms of RCT. 
		  
		  The major issues in relation to eRCT are:</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">1.  Contracts that may incur RCT must be registered on ROS. </p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">2.  Payment notification must be sent prior to actual payment.  Revenue will then provide the appropriate RCT 
		  rate by automated reply. Failure to provide this notification prior to issuing a payment to a subcontractor 
		  may incur a penalty of €5,000 or 35% of the contract, whichever is the lesser.</p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">3.  The eRCT process involves a four step online process. </p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">4.  Subcontractors may no longer claim an interim refund – instead RCT is offset against other tax liability and 
		  a refund is only applicable at year end with there is an excess in their overall liability.		  </p>
		<P align="center" class="style9">5.  There are 3 RCT rates under the eRCT regime – 0%, 20% and 35% (the latter for suppliers not known to 
		  Revenue)		  </p>
		<P align="center" class="style6">6.  C2 cards are no longer valid.   
		  
		  In circumstances, where staff are likely to be processing payments that may incur RCT, contact should be made 
		  in the first instance with the Finance Unit to enable the payment process to occur. </p>
